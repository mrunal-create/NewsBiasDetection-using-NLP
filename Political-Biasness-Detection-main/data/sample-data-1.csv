"LUCKNOW: Even as the Opposition has been mounting attack on government over the amended citizenship law by calling it anti-Muslim, BJP has come up with a plan to use the legislation to consolidate its support base among Dalits in the state, considered a core vote bank of BSP.

Top BJP sources said the party has directed leaders and cadre to visit Dalit-dominated pockets and tell them that the citizenship law is in favour of SCs and STs who migrated to India after facing persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

BJP also plans to use the promulgation of the new citizenship law to win over educated youth ahead of elections for the 11 graduates' and teachers' constituency seats of the legislative council. Sources said the party seeks to neutralize the Opposition's allegations accusing BJP of bringing a law against Muslims, Dalits and poor.

The saffron party has roped in its Dalit cadres in the drive, days after PM Narendra Modi said that most of the persecuted minorities in Paksitan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan belonged to lower castes.

UP BJP general secretary and in charge of the SC/ST Morcha, Govind Narayan Shukla confirmed that SC cadres will be part of the ongoing Jan Jagran campaign to remove any apprehensions among Dalits about the citizenship law.

He said, ""The party has asked all its organisational wings to fan out across the state, essentially in violence-hit areas, for interactions.""

Some Dalits got swayed by the Opposition propaganda during anti-CAA protests, said another party leader. ""Dalits and poor need to be told separately that there is nothing against them in the law,"" he said.

UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal will directly monitor the campaign through WhatsApp groups, said sources. Party functionaries have been asked to click photos of their meetings with different caste groups and upload them on the groups.",BJP
"JALANDHAR: While Punjab BJP cadre appear enthusiastic after their party managed to make the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) do an about-face in Delhi, a figure cited by party's state unit president Ashwani Sharma, in two meetings of with workers about missed calls from Punjab in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), tells a different story.

Sources said during a meeting of BJP members in Chandigarh on Monday, Sharma had said there were just over 1 lakh missed calls on the mobile number given by the party to register support for the CAA.

On Wednesday, he is said to have reiterated the figure in a meeting in Amritsar as he asked party workers to pull up socks, saying that the number was too low as there were 30 lakh members of the party in Punjab.

When asked on Thursday about BJP's claims of huge growth in its membership in Punjab in light of such a low number of calls in support of CAA, Sharma claimed that he ""deliberately cited a low figure before the party workers"" to push them for working more aggressively on the issue. ""These are internal things of the party. I shall give the final number after this campaign will end. We never give exact figures when a campaign is on so that workers don't get complacent,"" he added.

Asked what is the actual number, he said, ""Real number is several times higher than what I said and we shall disclose it once the campaign is over.""

About the party's membership in Punjab, he insisted that there were total 30 lakh members of BJP in the state.

When BJP launched its membership drive through missed calls, the party leaders claimed that over 23 lakh members were registered. Asked how many of the 23 lakh members registered through missed calls could finally be verified, he said that the number was 18 lakh and the party even had their addresses. ""There were only 5-7 % who could not be verified. Now, our total membership the membership is touching 30 lakh,"" Sharma said. Punjab BJP membership in charge Dyal Singh Sodhi claimed that in the membership drive last year, 10 lakh new members were enrolled. ""Now total membership is above 30 lakh,"" he too insisted.",BJP
"Protestors opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) have often raised ""kagaz nahi dikhayenge"" (won't show papers) slogans in order to register their defiance to the Act.

Senior RSS functionary Ram Lal has predicted that the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protestors, who have often voiced their resistance to the Act by saying they will not show official documents to prove their identity, will be dealt a blow by the results of Delhi assembly polls, said a news agency report.

Ram Lal also urged voters to carry their official documents with them and keep in mind who can make Delhi the best capital city in the world, when they press the button on the voting machine. He made the comments after casting his vote in the capital on Saturday.

""My message to the voters is 'aaj apna kagaz jaroor lekar jayen. Kagaz jaroor dikhayen' (Take your document with you today and you must show your document, that's my appeal to you),"" Lal said.

Protestors opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) have often raised ""kagaz nahi dikhayenge"" (won't show papers) slogans in order to register their defiance to the Act.

Ram Lal said that Delhi will get a government that can coordinate with the Centre.

""Today, mentality of not showing documents will be defeated and,"" he said.

Another senior BJP leader Shyam Jaju, made a similar comment by claiming that those who were allegedly funding the anti-CAA stir Shaheen Bagh will be defeated in the polls along with their supporters.

"Addressing a rally at Badarpur Assembly constituency in the Capital, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath attacked the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and also talked about the efforts of the Modi government at the Centre.

Having arrived two hours late, Mr. Adityanath said: ""I would have been here at five o'clock. I had planned my programme accordingly but because of Shaheen Bagh...""

He then started speaking about the various efforts made by the Modi government such as the Ayushman Bharath Scheme, Swachh Bharat Mission and others.

He said the Kejriwal government did not allow various schemes of the Centre to be implemented in the Capital.

He said Arvind Kejriwal (Chief Minister) was trying to create tension in the city by supporting protesters in Shaheen Bagh. He also told the crowd: ""Do you want a BJP government or a government of people feeding Shaheen Bagh biryani?""

He dismissed the stirs as ""excuses"", saying that the protesters want the removal of Article 370 and triple talaq.

The protesters are against the win in the Ayodhya temple case, he added.

In relation to CAA, he said action has been taken against people protesting against the Act in Uttar Pradesh.

He said properties of protesters in his State were seized to recover the costs of public damage.

The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister said after coming to power, he not only ensured safe passage to the devotees in Kanwar yatras but also ensured that the police did not disturb them during their programmes that include music and DJs.

"HYDERABAD: Immediately after TRS swept the civic elections in Telangana on Saturday, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao told reporters at the party headquarters that his government would pass a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in the state assembly. This would make Telangana the fourth state to pass such a resolution after Kerala, Punjab and Rajasthan.

He also revived talk of a federal front and said both the Congress and BJP had failed the country.

""It may not happen immediately, but I believe that the front will form the next government at the Centre."" He added that he supported abrogation of Article 370 and opposed the CAA in the interest of the nation. TRS had voted against CAA in Parliament.

Stressing that CAA was ""100% a big mistake"", he said that he would mobilise support of like-minded regional party leaders and the 15-odd chief ministers, who are against CAA, and hold a conference in Hyderabad soon. ""If required a public meeting with 10 lakh people will be organized in the city,"" he added.

KCR also said that in his view, the Supreme Court should take up CAA suo moto and scrap it. ""I request the prime ministers to withdraw CAA as it is against the preamble of the Constitution,"" he said. ""The image of our country is at stake globally.""

""Instead of focussing on the important issues like recession, literacy and poverty, the government was raking up the Hindu-Muslim issue,"" he said. ""Is it good if you send Muslims out of the country? What happens if Hindus living in outside India are asked to leave? Besides, BJP is already losing one states after another. It lost Jharkhand recently and reports indicate that AAP may win Delhi,"" the chief minister said.

The TRS supremo blamed the Centre for the economic slowdown in the country. ""Economists have been expressing concern over the recession and millions of people have lost their jobs. The states too were suffering because of the economic slowdown.""

He added that the NDA government has not released Rs 34,000 crore to states towards GST relief and other devolution of funds. ""The state government is yet to release Rs 1,131 crore and another Rs 2,812 crore towards IGST.

The body was taken to Kingsway Camp, where the last rites were performed.

""He was ill on Monday. He had high fever. His wife asked him to take leave but he still went. What could he do also especially in this situation and when there are fewer officers,"" Lal's brother-in-law Deepak Bari said.

Mr. Bari said Lal's wife received a call around 4 p.m. that he had been injured and was in a serious condition. ""She then called us in Jaipur where we reside. We switched on the TV and news reports said he had died. We immediately left for Delhi,"" he said.

Five of the other dead have been identified as Mohammed Furkan, Shahid Khan, Nazim, Vinod and Rahul Solanki. Outside the mortuary of Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, on Tuesday, families of deceased gathered to receive the bodies of their loved ones.

Hari Singh Solanki, Rahul's father, a resident of Dayalpur, said he called the police control room around 3 p.m. after he sensed tensions escalating in the area, but no one turned up. ""I called all the police officers whose numbers I had but no one turned up. My son died when he had gone to buy milk just around the corner. He was shot,"" he said.

""We took him to a nursing home nearby; they refused to treat him. We wanted to take him to GTB Hospital straight but the road was blocked due to clashes. We then took him to a government hospital but he was dead by then,"" the father said.

Shahid's brother Imran said he got married four months ago and his wife was pregnant. ""He is an autorickshaw driver and had gone to work in the morning. Around 4 p.m., we were informed that he had been shot. We found his body two hours later,"" he said.

He was a resident of New Mustafabad and native of Bulandshahr. Imran said their brother had got a WhatsApp message of the death in their village. ""He received his photos on WhatsApp and called me. We went looking for him but couldn't find him for two hours. We were informed that he was shot in Bhajanpura,"" he said.

Subsequently, the family was informed that he has been brought to a nursing home close to their residence. They then went there and brought the body.

"The die has been cast. Now, it is up to the voters to decide! After a no-holds-barred campaign, it is time for the people of the Capital to come out and exercise the franchise at 13,750 polling booths on Saturday.

While the ruling AAP is making a bid to return to power, the BJP is seeking to get its chief minister in the National Capital after 20 years. The Congress, which has ruled Delhi for 15 years, is expecting resurgence in its vote share which switched to AAP in 2015 when Arvind Kejriwal's party won 67 of the 70 Assembly seats. The BJP had won three and the Congress none in 2015.

Over 1.47 crore people, including 2.08 lakh first-time votes are eligible to vote today. Of the 672 candidates in the fray, 148 are independents and 79 women. In 2015 the poll percentage was 67.47 while it was 65.86 in 2013.

THE LAST LEG

In the last few days before the poll day, AAP and BJP used all their might trying to woo voters through rallies, roadshows and door-to-door meetings across the Capital. Some star campaigners of the Congress, which otherwise showed a low-key attempt, were also seen building the momentum with a few rallies and public meetings in the last few days. Having tried to fight much of the election campaign on the strength of its government's achievements, particularly in health and education, Arvind Kejriwal's AAP was forced to address the BJP's persistent attacks on him as an anti-national a couple of days ahead of polls.

The BJP, through its top brass including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, tried to corner the AAP government on issues of governance and, of course, Shaheen Bagh, where women are leading one of the longest anti-CAA protests.

Throughout the campaign, Kejriwal held 200 meetings, which included 34 roadshows, 15 public meetings and 13 townhalls. The BJP organised thousands of meetings, padyastras and roadshows and rallies addressed by top leaders including Modi and Shah. The Congress held four public meetings addressed by Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi and 150 small public meetings with star campaigner.

""Delhi BJP held 6577 meetings for the Assembly elections from December 22, 2019 to February 6, 2020 including Nukkad meetings, roadshows and rallies. PM Narendra Modi had addressed three rallies, HM Amit Shah held 52 public meetings, roadshows and nukkad meetings. National president Jagat Prakash Nadda had 41 public meetings, roadshows and nukkad meetings,"" said BJP's convener of Assembly Election Committee and national secretary Tarun Chugh.

Delhi has traditionally voted differently in Assembly and general elections. BJP has, so far, retained its 32-35 per cent vote share in Assembly polls in Delhi. It, however, got 46.5 per cent in 2014 Lok Sabha polls and 56.5 per cent in 2019. For AAP, the share plummeted to 18 per cent in 2019 from 33 per cent in 2014 elections.

MANIFESTOS FOR A BETTER DELHI

All the three parties promised a better Delhi in their manifestos. AAP's 28-point manifesto focused mostly on its earlier promises while talking of a deshbhakti course in government schools. Apart from taking forward the 13 assurances that featured in the 70-point action plan of 2015, AAP's 2020 manifesto had promises of reviving the Yamuna, justice for victims of 1984 Sikh riots, and regularisation of unauthorised colonies, to name a few.

It also promises to consider keeping shops, restaurants open round the clock on the lines of Mumbai. BJP offered a host of promises, including some freebies and Rs 10 lakh jobs, promotion of e-vehicles, availability of wheat flour to poor families at Rs 2 per kilogram. Congress offered free electricity up to monthly consumption of 300 units, 25 per cent of the budget to environment to curb pollution.

MULLAH, MEMES AND DRUGS

Election officials said that the law enforcement agencies - Delhi Police, Excise Department and Narcotics Control Bureau have seized illegal cash, liquor, and contrabands to a tune of Rs 55.

crore with Rs 10 crore cash. The numbers are much higher, in fact 25 fold, than last Assembly election (2015) when Rs 2.1 crore was seized ahead of polls. Unlike, 2015, the 2020 poll campaign by all three parties witnessed a social media slugfest being played out on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram - with the ostensible objective of wooing Delhi's more than 17 lakh voters aged between 18 years and 25 years.

The choice of arsenal in the aggressive round of exchanges was live videos on Facebook and Instagram, apart from, of course, scorching memes.

WAR OF WORDS

Even as the campaigning ended on Thursday, AAP, BJP and the Congress indulged in a war of words on Friday. A day after an officer on special duty in Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia's office was arrested by the CBI for alleged bribery, BJP MP Parvesh Verma drew a link between the incident and the Shaheen Bagh protests. ""OSD is just for name... This money goes into Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia's pocket, who spends it on biryani for people at Shaheen Bagh,"" Parvesh Verma, told a news agency.

Sisodia promptly responded to the BJP MP's comment by sending him a legal notice. Sisodia had earlier took to Twitter saying that he was aware of the arrest of a GST inspector for taking bribe. ""This officer was posted in my office as OSD. CBI should get him punished strictly.

I have got many such corrupt officials caught in last five years,"" Sisodia tweeted. Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra said that the OSD will not take bribe without the consent of his boss - Manish Sisodia.",BJP
"KOLKATA/HOWRAH: Aishe Ghosh on Friday attacked RSS and its affiliates BJP and ABVP for targeting the student community and democratic atmosphere on campuses. The JNU students' union president was at Jadavpur University to address members of the Students' Federation of India (SFI). She said the RSS feared the nation-wide agitation by students against its ideology of a homogeneous culture and ""Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan"".

Sources on campus said Ghosh attacked ABVP because the RSS-affiliated students' body has fielded nine candidates in various panels in Arts and engineering for the first time. ""It (ABVP) is an organization which sends masked goons to campuses to beat up those who stand for the rights of students and campus democracy. They believe in using force whereas universities are places that provide space for free speech and debates,"" said Ghosh.

ABVP had earlier objected to Ghosh's programme on the campus as the modal code of conduct has come into play. After the university authorities refused permission, Ghosh's programme was shifted outside gate 4.

Earlier in the day, after walking in a rally in Howrah, the students' leader said the Trinamool was creating space for RSS and BJP in the state by preventing others from hitting the streets against CAA and NRC. ""If Trinamool was serious about resisting CAA and NRC, they would have aligned with other like-minded organizations,"" said Ghosh who was prevented from attending a programme in Calcutta University on Thursday.

""The objective of Trinamool Congress is to create space for BJP and RSS in the state by muzzling all other voices,"" Ghosh signed off.

In the evening, Ghosh addressed students at presidency University before visiting the sit-in at Park Circus to interact with the protesters who have been demonstrating there for over a month. More than 1,500 people turned up to see her. ""I have immense respect for you who have been protesting here to save the country and the Constitution despite having so many other responsibilities. You are making a huge sacrifice and I have come to assure you that the entire student community is behind you. I will go back to Delhi and tell my comrades about the brave women of Kolkata.

"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Amid a high voltage protest and boycott by the opposition Congress-led UDF, on Wednesday presented his policy address in the assembly and read out references to anti-CAA resolution passed by the house, despite disagreeing with it.

Reading out the the anti-CAA stand of the state government, the governor said, ""Our citizenship can never be on the basis of religion as this goes against the grain of secularism which is part of the basic structure of our constitution.""

Referring to the unanimous anti-CAA resolution passed by the assembly, Khan, who has been at loggerheads with the state government for moving the Supreme Court against the law and the resolution against it, said the government believes the Act ""goes against the cardinal principles"" underlying the Constitution.

""Strong states and strong centre are pillars of our federalism. The voices of genuine apprehension of the states need to be considered by the central government in the right spirit keeping broad national interest in mind, particularly when constitutional values are involved and there are widespread anxieties and apprehensions among a large number of our citizenry,"" he said.

It's learnt that the governor decided to read out the reference to the state's anti-CAA stance after a letter was sent by Vijayan on Wednesday morning, in which the chief minister had requested Khan to read the policy address ""in its entirety sans any additions or deletions.""

""Since the constitutional function under Art 176 is exercised with the aid and advise of the council of ministers, it is requested that the address approved by the council of ministers be read in its entirety sans any additions or deletions,"" the letter stated.

The day also saw an unprecedented protest by the UDF members, who also boycotted the policy address.

As the governor was being ushered into the assembly hall by Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, UDF members, blocked Khan, raised ""Go Back"" slogans holding aloft ""Repeal CAA"" and ""Recall governor"" placards and banners.

Speaker was seen repeatedly trying to pacify the agitating MLAs but in vain, after which the watch and ward personnel, who stood as a wall protecting the governor, cleared his path to the dais.

In his policy address, Khan said though he had his ""reservations and disagreement"" over the subject, he would read the para 18 containing reference to anti-CAA matter, just to ""honour"" the wish of the Chief Minister.

When Khan began his policy address, the opposition members trooped out of the assembly hall raising slogans and staged a sit in protest at the gate of the Assembly.

""This august body (Kerala Assembly) unanimously passed a resolution requesting the Central government to abrogate the CAA 2019 which my government believes goes against the cardinal principles underlying our Constitution,"" he said.

The government has also filed a petition in the supreme court invoking Art 131 of the constitution, Governor said.

As he was leaving the assembly, reporters asked him about the unprecedented protest faced by him, to which the Governor quipped that he had faced worst protests than this.

Meanwhile, taken by surprise over the governor's move to read out Anti CAA reference in his address, Leader of Opposition, Ramesh Chennithala, who protested along with his front MLAs, told media that the state government and the Governor had come to a ""truce"".

""The double stand of the chief minister has been exposed now. The CM begged the Governor to read the policy address in full.

Why is the CM silent on the Governor who has insulted the people of Kerala? This is a ploy to escape from the Lavlin case which may come up soon,"" Chennithala alleged.

The Top Court has been hearings a batch of petitions challenging the Kerala High Court's 2018 order discharging Vijayan, the then State Electricity Minister, and others in an alleged graft case involving an award of contract to a Canadian firm SNC-Lavalin for the renovation and modernisation of three Hydroelectric projects in 1997.

Expressing solidarity with the Governor, BJP's Kerala unit took out a march to the Assembly complex.

Attacking the UDF, former BJP President, Kummanam Rajashekharan asked, ""who gave authority to Congress to stop the Governor?..""

""By blocking the Governor, the UDF has insulted the people of Kerala,"" he said.

Khan had made it clear that he was not a ""rubber stamp"" and it was ""improper"" that he was not informed by the government before moving the apex court.",congress

"Bengaluru: Condemning the police attack at the Jamia Millia Islamia University library in December, historian Ramachandra Guha on Friday said authoritarians, including high-ranking officials of the British Raj and former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, had spared varsity libraries as they read books.

Speaking at a panel discussion on Citizenship: Identity and Migration, organised by The Network of Women in Media-India, Guha said: ""Students were active in protesting against the British during the Quit India movement and during the JP movement against Indira Gandhi, but police never vandalised university libraries. Although the Viceroy and Indira Gandhi were authoritarians, they read books.""

Referring to the library attack at Jamia on December 15, Guha said: ""The politics behind CAA is to make Indian Muslims second-class citizens in the country. It's a discriminatory act as only Muslims will be persecuted.""

""The DNA of the government is to create hatred and fear of Muslims and not love for Hindus or pride of Hinduism. This is apparent to anyone who has been to Gujarat. NRC is aimed to intimidate and harass Indian Muslims,"" the historian said.

Referring to the abrogation of Article 370 and turning the Muslim-majority state of Kashmir into a Union territory, he said the sufferings of ordinary Kashmiris who had nothing to do with terrorism or jihad have only worsened.

Hundreds of people protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act got into a scuffle with the Delhi Police this afternoon after they insisted on marching towards the Parliament House. The protesters included students from Jamia Millia Islamia, its alumni and the locals from the surrounding areas.

Shouting ""Kagaz nahin dikhayenge (we won't show any documents)"" the protesters -- had started the march from the university. But barely two km away, they were intercepted by the police, who said the protesters did not have any permission to march to parliament.

The scuffle broke out at the last barricade when the protesters insisted on moving forward. Visuals from the area showed some trying to jump over barricades as police in riot gear tried to stop them.

Some of the protesters have been detained by the police.

The clash came as the Supreme Court issued notices to the Centre and the Delhi government over the two-month-long protest at Shaheen Bang, which has come to be known as the epicentre of the agitation against the controversial law.

The court took note as a 12-year-old National Bravery Award Winner wrote to Chief Justice Bobde over the recent death of a four-month-old baby, whose mother had been taking him to the protest ground in the freezing cold. ""No protest can be held in a common area for so long,"" the court said.

Along with Shaheen Bagh, the Jamia university has also been witnessing protests since the citizenship law was passed in December.

The CAA provides for citizenship for non-Muslim minorities from Muslim-majority countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan if they fled religious persecution and entered India before 2015. Critics believe the law, along with the NRC, will be used to target Muslims.

"NEW DELHI: The government on Saturday allocated Rs 2826.92 crore to the sports budget for the next financial year, which is up by a mere Rs 50 crore from the revised estimates of 2019-20.

The government gave a substantial hike of Rs 291.42 crore to its flagship Khelo India programme for development of sports at the grassroot and youth level, which meant that most of the other heads got reduced allocation in an Olympic year.

The highest reduction was for National Sports Federations with Rs 245.00 crore being allocated in the union budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Rs 55 crore less than the revised Rs 300.85 for 2019-20.

As far as incentives for sportspersons are concerned, the budget has proposed to slash the amount from Rs 111 crore to Rs 70 crore. The budget for National Sports Development Fund also got reduced to Rs 50.00 from the earlier Rs 77.15 crore.

The government also reduced the allocation to Sports Authority of India (SAI) from the revised Rs 615 crore to Rs 500 crore. The SAI is the nodal organisation to manage nationals camps, provide infrastructure, equipment and other logistics to the country's sportspersons.

The allocation for the 2010 Commonwealth Games-SAI stadia renovation was also slashed to Rs 75 crore from Rs 96 crore last year.

National Welfare Fund for Sportspersons will continue to get the same amount of Rs 2 crore as earlier, while, at Rs 50 crore, there was also no change in the allocation for the enhancement of sports facilities in Jammu and Kashmir.

Laxmi Bai National Institute of Physical Education will, however, get Rs 55 crore, Rs 5 crore more than the last budget.

Kasturi Basu, a resident of Patuli in south Kolkata, had come back from her routine evening door-to-door campaign against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) on Sunday night when about half a dozen men barged into her house and 'threatened' her for campaigning against the citizenship law.

Ms. Basu is a well-known activist and documentary film maker.

""My partner and I reached home when around 9 pm the apartment's caretaker informed me that seven men who identify themselves as BJP workers have barged into the premises and are looking for me,"" she said.

Ms. Basu and her partner Dwaipayan Banerjee, also an activist, are two of the founding members of the People's Film Collective (PFC), a people-funded body that screens films every month in the city. They also hold the annual People's Film Festival. Writers like Arundhati Roy and film makers like Anand Patwardhan took part in the PFC's festivals.

""Firstly, America is putting pressure and (Narendra) Modi is succumbing to completely open up our economy which is the gain they want to achieve in order to give support to Modi on issues like CAA, Article 370 and others, Yechury told reporters on the sideline of an anti-CAA rally here.

""That is the quid pro quo going on, which is not in India's interest.

""The price hike is completely unwarranted. The international oil prices are not on escalating. In fact it is de-escalating a little.

""This is all because of the crisis created in the balance sheets of our oil majors by the Modi government which started borrowing from them in terms of greater dividends and destroying the balance sheet,"" he alleged.

""In order to stabilise the balance sheets, they are doing it (price hike of LPG cylinder). There is no necessity at all for increasing the price,"" Yechury said, adding the balance sheet is rectified in order to prepare the oil majors for disinvestment.

"Marcus Joseph and Henry Kisekka have to fire again for the host

Gokulam Kerala is easily one of the stronger sides in the I-League, but it has not quite been able to translate that reputation into performance. Take for instance its match against TRAU last weekend; it had to settle for a draw despite taking an early lead and dominating the match.

The host will have to come up with a better show if it has to return to winning ways in its match on Saturday. Its rival Real Kashmir is no pushover.

It is not just one of the most inspiring stories coming out of Indian sport in recent times, it is quite a formidable side, too. It is placed sixth in table with 12 points. Gokulam has 14 points and is fourth but has played a match more.

Fernando Santiago Valera's boys have to show more consistency if they want to mount a serious challenge for the title. After beating East Bengal 3-1 -- perhaps their best win yet of the season -- they lost 1-3 to Punjab, defeated Churchill Brothers 1-0 and drew 1-1 with TRAU.

Real Kashmir will start in a more confident frame of mind, having won both its last matches. It had scored identical 2-0 wins over Indian Arrows and Aizawl, both away encounters. The addition to the squad of striker Robin Singh and defender Rena Salton -- both loaned from ISL side Hyderabad FC -- is a boost.

Kashmir's coach David Robertson said Gokulam was a tough rival. ""They were built up as one of the favourites for the title this season,"" he told The Hindu. ""But they have had ups and downs this season, like us.""

Gokulam must be hoping that Saturday's match will be one of the ups. For that to happen, Marcus Joseph and Henry Kisekka, the two imports who have formed one of the most lethal combinations up front in the I-League, may have to continue with their scoring spree. Together they have netted 10 of their team's 12 goals.",None
"The Assam government will soon bring in a law to convert all government-run madrassas and Sanskrit tols (ashrams where Sanskrit is taught) into high schools and higher secondary schools, said Assam education minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Wednesday.

Sarma said this process would be completed in the next two months.

""These madrassas will function within a regulatory framework. We are bringing a law where government-run madrassas have to function under a regulatory framework and disclose the number of students enrolled. They will have to compulsorily teach general subjects along with religious one,"" Himanta Biswa Sarma said.

Explaining the rationale for this, Himanta Biswa Sarma said, ""Since the state is a secular institution, it can't fund religious teaching.""

He said the Assam government has been running madrassas and Sanskrit tols and it is the result of this that today Assam has nearly 1,200 madrasas and 200 Sanskrit tols.

Himanta Biswa Sarma said the government has decided to convert them to high and higher secondary schools because at present there is no independent board to regulate them.

""These (govt-run madrassas and Sanskrit tols) issue certificates which are equivalent to metriculation (Class 10) and higher secondary (Class 12). Since there is no regulatory board to govern them, a lot of wrongdoings take place in issuing these certificates,"" the minister said.

He however clarified that this decision will not affect privately run madrassas. ""The Assam government has no issue with the madrassas that are being run by various social organisations and NGOs.

"The renaming of Basti district after Maharishi Vashishth appears to be on the cards with the local administration sending a proposal on this to the state's revenue board.

District Magistrate Ashutosh Niranjan said the proposal to change the name of the district has been sent to the revenue board and the expenditure for it is pegged around Rs 1 crore.

The Adityanath government has changed the name Allahabad to Prayagraj and Faizabad to Ayodhya. It has also renamed Mughalsarai railway station after Deen Dayal Upadhyay.

According to officials, about a year ago during Basti Mahotsav, Chief Minister Adityanath had announced that Basti Medical College will be named after Maharishi Vashishth, who according to Hindu mythology was the guru of Lord Rama.

After that announcement, a number of people including MP Harish Dwivedi and MLA Ajay Kumar Singh demanded changing the name of the district.

On November 28 last year, the proposal of changing the name of the district was sent to the Revenue Board which sought an estimated cost for the purpose, officials said.

Following proper analysis on the expenditure which is likely to be incurred District magistrate Ashutosh Niranjan sent the revised report to Commissioner Anil Kumar Sagar who in turn forwarded it to the the government, they added.

Some believe that Basti was earlier known as Vaishishthi.

According to Hindu mythology, the modern day Basti district was the ashram of Sage Vashishth the teacher of Lord Ram and his brother Lakshman.

"Waris Pathan said his statement is being twisted to target and defame him (File)

Mumbai:

After massive outrage over his ""15-crore (Muslims) will prove stronger than the 100-crore majority (Hindus)"" comment, AIMIM former legislator from Maharashtra, Waris Pathan, on Saturday withdrew his controversial statement, saying he had no intentions to hurt the sentiments of any community.

""My statement is being twisted to target and defame me and my party due to a political conspiracy. However, I take back my words if they hurt anyone and apologise for the same. I am a true and proud citizen of this country,"" Mr Pathan told reporters in Mumbai.

Last week, amid protests against the contentious citizenship law, Mr Pathan was heard in a video that went viral saying, ""We have to move together. We have to take Azadi (freedom), things that we don't get by asking, we have to take it by force, remember it.""

""Now time has come, we are told that we have sent our mothers and sisters in the front and were sitting covered in blanket... Only our lionesses have come out and you are already sweating.

"Ramlila Maidan: An AAP supporter at the oath ceremony of Arvind Kejriwal in New Delhi (AFP)

Arvind Kejriwal today thanked the people of Delhi for ensuring their ""son"" returns as Chief Minister of the national capital for a third time. After taking oath at the historic Ramlila Maidan today, Mr Kejriwal addressed thousands of people, who cheered for him as he started speaking.

""Your son has taken the oath of Chief Minister for a third time. This is not my win, this is your victory. This is the victory of every Delhi wala, every mother, every sister, every youth, every student, every family in Delhi,"" Mr Kejriwal said.

""In the last five years we have tried to work on how to ensure every family can become happier, give some relief in their lives, how to develop Delhi fast... In the next five years our effort on this will go on,"" he said.

""Everyone, call your villages and tell them 'our son has become Chief Minister, there is no need to worry',"" the Chief Minister said, drawing applause from the crowd.

The Aam Aadmi Party won 62 seats in the Delhi assembly election - a near repeat of its 2015 tally of 67 seats at the end of one of the most polarising campaigns in the backdrop of the anti-CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) protests.

The national capital has a large population of people from all walks of life who have come from outside the city. Mr Kejriwal's message today that they should ""call home"" to tell their ""son"" is the Chief Minister is being seen as his acknowledgement of their support.

""Some people voted AAP, some voted for BJP, some for Congress, but when I took oath as Chief Minister, I am the Chief Minister of everyone, of AAP, BJP, Congress and other parties. I have never been biased against anyone, have never said 'I won't help you because you voted for BJP'. I will work for everyone. In areas in the city where the BJP is strong, I have put water pipes, improved roads,"" Mr Kejriwal said.

In 2015 too, Mr Kejriwal's oath-taking ceremony took place at the Ramlila Maidan. It was held on February 14, coinciding with Valentine's Day. In 2013 after his party's first poll victory, the swearing-in ceremony was again held at the same venue.

"Prime Minister says these decisions were necessary in national interest.

Despite international pressure, the government will continue to stand by its decision to revoke Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and introduce the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted on Sunday.

He said the country had ""awaited"" these decisions for many years. ""In national interest, these decisions were necessary,"" Mr. Modi said at an event in his parliamentary constituency Varanasi.

""Aur duniyabhar ke sare dawaabo ke bawajood, in faislo par hum kayam hai aur kayam rahenge [Despite the various international pressures, we stand by these decisions and will continue to stand by them,"" Mr. Modi said. The country was now taking decisions that were always left behind in the past, he added.

The Prime Minister's tough talk assumed significance in view of protests against the CAA in various parts of the country.

In Varanasi, Mr. Modi launched projects worth ?1,250 crore. He unveiled the statue of Deendayal Upadhyay, which, at 63 feet, is the largest statue of the leader in the country, as per the government. The Prime Minister also dedicated to the nation the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Memorial Centre.

Mr. Modi flagged off the third corporate train, Mahakaal Express, which links three Jyotirling pilgrim centres -- Varanasi, Ujjain and Omkareshwar.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Modi attended the closing ceremony of the centenary celebration of Jagadguru Vishwaradhya Gurukul at Jangamwadi Mutt and released the translated version of 'Shri Siddhant Shikhamani Granth' in 19 languages. He also launched the 'Shri Siddhant Shikhamani Granth' mobile app.

Citing certain key decisions of his government, Mr. Modi referred to the trust set up for the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya and said it would work ""rapidly.""

He said that after setting up of the trust, the work on the construction of 'Ram dham' would start fast and added that his government had also decided to transfer 67 acres of land to the trust.

He also inaugurated a 430-bed superspeciality government hospital.

Mr. Modi said that in the past few years, ?25,000 crore worth developmental projects had either been completed or were going on at a fast pace in Varanasi.

Roadway, highway, waterway and railway had been given top priority by the government and the Purvanchal Expressway work was going on at fast speed in Uttar Pradesh.

"GUWAHATI: A local court on Monday extended by four days the police remand of JNU student Sharjeel Imam who was arrested on charges of sedition and brought to the state last week.

Imam was brought to Assam from New Delhi on February 20 and produced in ourt which had initially sent him to four days' police remand, they said.

Upon the expiry of his police remand, he was on Monday produced before the Kamrup (Metro) Chief Judicial Magistrate.

The student, who came into the limelight during the ongoing protests at Shaheen Bagh against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, was arrested from Bihar's Jehanabad on January 28 for allegedly making inflammatory speeches at the Jamia Millia Islamia University and in Aligarh.

Imam was slapped with a sedition case after his speeches went viral on social media wherein he was heard allegedly speaking about Assam's possible secession from the country in the wake of the CAA.

A case under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) has been registered against him in Assam.

On February 18, the Delhi Police had named Imam as an ""instigator"" in its charge sheet filed against 17 people in a case related to violence during protests against the CAA at New Friends Colony near Jamia Millia Islamia last year.

Meanwhile, Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the state government is keeping a tab on the developments related to Imam's interrogation.

"Hyderabad: The NDA government has not defined whether the USD 5 trillion dollars economy it aims to achieve is real GDP or nominal, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said on Saturday and claimed real GDP would not touch the figure at the current growth level by 2024 or 2025.

Chidambaram, who spoke on the Union Budget at a meeting organised by the party here, hit out at the government for allegedly proving to be incompetent in managing the economy. ""Firstly, the Modi government has still not defined whether 5 trillion dollars is real GDP or nominal.

Secondly, while Modi keeps on saying 2024, the economic survey, in the introduction, the goalpost has been shifted from 2024 to 2025. Be that as it may, at the current level of growth, real GDP will not touch 5 trillion dollars either by 2024 or 2025,"" the former Finance minister said.

Chidambaram was replying to a query on the government's ambitious target of USD 5 trillion economy. Interacting with the audience, he said the NDA government should not ""clutter"" the tax structure by seeking to introduce separate systems, one giving exemptions and other not.

Asked by a member of the audience whether there is a possibility of the government withdrawing various tax exemptions leading to the common man not having options to save money and tax, he felt that there was still confusion within the government on the matter.

""Even if all the income tax payers opt for the new system, the maximum benefit will be Rs 40,000 crore.What is Rs 40,000 crore when India's GDP is almost 2.7 trilllion dollars,"" he said. The impact would be so minimal that it won't make a big difference, he claimed.

Noting that the IT exemptions are savings, he said their withdrawal would lead to a decline in the savings habit which is not good for the country. ""More than anything else, I don't think the tax structure should be cluttered like this. You don't have anywhere a tax structure, system A, system B, system A for exemptions...Without exemptions.

I think it is cluttering up tax system. I would not have done it. The sooner they clarify what their intention is, the better,"" he said.

On the proposed disinvestment in LIC, he said there was no clarity whether the government would list or disinvest the insurance behemoth. ""Without clarity about whether they are listing or disinvesting. I cannot comment on it. But on LIC, unless they convince me why they want to disinvest, our present position is we are deeply suspicious of their motives to disinvest LIC,"" he said.

Chidambaram, who lashed out at the Union Budget for allegedly failing to lead the economy on the path of progress and job creation, alleged that the Modi government was like a helpless doctor who failed to diagnose the illness of a patient and treat him effectively.

""Altogether, the bottomline is we have a patient who is extremely ill. Doctor has proved himself incompetent. Diagnosis of the doctor is hopelessly wrong,"" he said.

People who diagnosed the illness correctly like Dr Arvind Subramanian, former Chief Economic Adviser, were allowed to go from the government, he said.""Not having diagnosed the illness of the patient, the doctor is helpless. The least the doctor can do is to say...I am sorry.

We made mistake, will Dr Manmohan Singh come and advise us,"" he said.

Asked whether it is true that the country spends one per cent GDP to keep 950,000 troops in Kashmir, he said there were more troops there than necessary. ""I think we are keeping many, many more troops in Kashmir than I would ever accept as necessary. I think it is wrong. We should thin out our troops deployment in Kashmir.

More than that, I think we should give back the freedom to the people of the Kashmir valley,"" Chidambaram said.

Slamming the Centre for invoking the Public Safety Act against former Jammu and Kashmir chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah to keep them in detention for upto a further two years, he said ""there cannot be a greater outrage, a greater assault on liberty than what they have done.

I think all of us should collectively pray for that the freedom of the people of Kashmir, the 75 lakh people of Kashmir valley, is restored,"" he added.",BJP
"In some respite relief for the people of Delhi-NCR, the Uttar Pradesh Police on Friday reopened a key route that links Noida with Delhi's Kalindi Kunj.

To ease congestion due to protests at Shaheen Bagh, the UP Police reopened the road leading from Kalindi Kunj towards Faridabad. The stretch from Noida's Mahamaya flyover to Delhi and Faridabad has been reopened, sources in the UP Police said.

The Shaheen Bagh-Kalindi Kunj road in southeast Delhi has been blocked for over two months due to ongoing protests against CAA.

The stretch of Shaheen Bagh to Kalindi Kunj road which is about two to three kilometres has commercial centres housing shops and restaurants. The road ends at Atlanta Water Park. The Shaheen Bagh-Kalindi Kunj road is parallel to the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway which is used by a large number of commuters between Delhi and Noida.

""The youths and patriots of this country and each worker of the BJP are ready to give a befitting reply to Waris Pathan in the same language he has used,"" Vyas said while speaking to TV9 news channel on Friday.

""We are tolerant and patient, but this not does mean that we cannot deal with them. Remember Gujarat, the incidents happened in Kalupur. If they take that into account...I feel the Muslims there today do not dare to rise again,"" he said.

"JAIPUR: A day after Pakistan declared locusts as ""national emergency"", fresh swarms were sighted at Srikaranpur tehsil and its villages in Sriganganagar district and at Dechu area in Jodhpur district on Sunday.

However, the agriculture and revenue department authorities and the Locust Control Organisation (LCO) were relieved as a very minimal presence of locusts was confined to Sriganganagar district only, out of the 10 other affected districts. The fresh attack has came as a major setback to their locust control programme.

Rajasthan started witnessing the locust attacks since May 2019 and after a minor gap in September, locust swarms were witnessed in western Rajasthan especially the border districts including Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh, Bikaner, Nagaur, Jodhpur, Churu, Barmer and Jaisalmer and others including Jalore and Sirohi. According to a government estimate, crops on 3.65 lakh hectare of land were damaged till January, while the farmers' union claimed in Rajasthan, around 7.17 lakh hectare of land has seen crop damage.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot had already told the district collectors in the affected districts to complete the crop damage assessment and distribute the compensation. In a symbolic protest, BJP MLA Bihari Lal Nokha in Rajasthan had recently entered the state assembly carrying a basket full of locusts to draw the government's attention to the farmers affected by the menace. ""On Sunday, we were informed about the fresh swarms of locusts which were witnessed at many villages in Srikaranpur tehsil of Sriganganagar district. We were also informed about fresh swarms at Dechu village in Jodhpur district. It is of course a fresh attack and is alarming as Pakistan on Saturday had declared swarms of locusts as national emergency,"" LK Gurjar, deputy director, LCO told TOI over phone from Srikaranpur.

Gurjar said that the authorities in various districts have enough pesticides and resources to further contain the locusts.

""When we had spoken to their authorities they had maintained that they have fully contained them (locusts), however Pakistan declared it as national emergency,"" said Gurjar.

"NEW DELHI: The anti-CAA protesters at Shaheen Bagh have extended an invitation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to come and celebrate Valentine's Day with them on Friday.

The protesters, who are staging a demonstration since December 15 last year demanding withdrawal of the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and a proposed all-India National Register of Citizens (NRC), will also unveil a ""love song"" and ""a surprise gift"" for Modi.

Posters at the protest site in south-east Delhi and also circulating on social media platforms read: ""PM Modi, please come to Shaheen Bagh, collect your gift and talk to us.""

""Whether Prime Minister Modi or home minister Amit Shah or anyone else, they can come and talk to us. If they can convince us that whatever is happening is not against the Constitution, we will end this protest,"" Syed Taseer Ahmed, one of the first protesters at Shaheen Bagh, told PTI.

He said according to the government's claims, the CAA was ""to award citizenship and not to take away someone's citizenship"", but nobody explained ""how is it going to help the country"".

""How is CAA going to help us tackle issues of unemployment, poverty and economic slowdown, which are the most pressing issues,"" Ahmed said.

Protests against the CAA and the NRC unfolded at Shaheen Bagh, Zakir Nagar, Jamia Nagar, Khureji Khas and other places in the national capital and elsewhere in the country in December.

The protesters at Shaheen Bagh have pitched a tent on a main road linking Noida to south-east Delhi via the Kalindi Kunj bridge, which, according to an official estimate, witnesses movement of around 1.75 lakh vehicles on a daily basis.

Ahmed said school buses, ambulances and emergency vehicles were allowed hassle-free movement since the protest started two months ago and the claim that the stir was causing a lot of problems to the common people was ""exaggerated"".

""Had it been at the levels as it is being portrayed by some people, we would have been evacuated from here long ago. The BJP would have won the Delhi polls and the Centre would have removed us. So, this claim that the Shaheen Bagh protest is causing major inconvenience is unsubstantiated,"" he added.

According to the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come to the country from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 after being subjected to religious persecution will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship. The law excludes Muslims.

Those opposing the law contend that it discriminates on the basis of religion and thus, violates the Constitution.

They also allege that the CAA, along with the NRC, is intended to target the Muslim community in India.

However, the Centre has dismissed the allegations, while maintaining that the law is intended to give citizenship to persecuted people from the three neighbouring countries and not to take away the citizenship of anyone.",BJP
"Resistance to CAA in some pockets has sometimes been described as anti-national, mostly by the leaders of the ruling party, the BJP.

Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram has said that we (the Indian society) have reached a point where the debate on secularism has shifted to a debate on who is a citizen of India. The senior Congress leader and former finance minister was speaking at a function organized by SBF India on Saturday.

Chidambaram's comments follow an intense ideological debate around the ideas of secularism, nationalism, and democracy taking place in the backdrop of the government's move to amend the Citizenship Act and the fears that it combined with a nationwide National Register of Citizens could be used to discriminate against the Muslims.

Resistance to the legislation in some pockets has sometimes been described as anti-national, mostly by the leaders of the ruling party, the BJP.

""We have had debates on secularism in the last 20, 30, 40 years, but we have reached a point where the debate on secularism has shifted to a debate on who is the citizen of India. Somehow, these two issues have been conflated, if you are secular today, there are people who will call you anti-national,"" Chidambaram said.

A few BJP leaders including UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and union minister Anurag Thakur were pulled up by the election commission for their speeches with potential to disturb the communal harmony. The BJP leaders made references to anti-CAA protestors, especially in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) as ""anti-national"" and alleged that those supporting the protestors were speaking the language of Pakistan.

""If you are secular today, they will call you, you are speaking the language of Pakistan, if you are secular, your patriotism is in question, and many of these people will also have their citizenship questioned in the course of time; that is the point of danger at which we have seemed to have arrived in the last few years,"" Chidambaram said.

"Days after a young woman in Bengaluru was arrested and slapped with sedition charges for raising Pakistan Zindabad slogans at an anti-Citizenship Amendment Act rally in Bengaluru, Karnataka's agriculture minister B C Patil has called for law to ""shoot at sight"" those who speak ill of India or raise pro-Pakistan slogans.

""In my opinion there is need for a law that has to be brought in India - Shoot at Sight law has to brought in India for those who speak ill of India or raise pro-Pakistan slogans. It is very much needed,"" Patil was quoted as saying by ANI.

Patil said he would request Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""to bring in a tough law to deal with traitors.""

""They're enjoying food, water and air of India. Why should they be here if they raise 'Pakistan zindabad' slogan? In China, people are scared to talk against their country. I request PM Modi to bring in a tough law to deal with traitors,"" Patil said.

Many BJP leaders have accused anti-CAA protesters of being traitors. In the campaign for the Delhi assembly elections recently, Union minister Anurag Thakur was slapped with a ban by the Election Commission after he egged a crowd at a rally to chant 'Shoot the traitiors'. Over the past two months police across the country have slapped sedition charges against many anti-CAA protesters.

Punishment under the Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code that deals with sedition ranges from imprisonment up to three years to a life term, to which fine may be added. A person charged under this law is also barred from a government job.

"NEW DELHI: The turnout in Delhi for the assembly election fell short of its record in 2015 when AAP had bagged 67 seats out of 70. It was a sunny Saturday but voting was sluggish till afternoon. According to the latest figure available with the EC, which is subject to revision, the turnout stood at 61.5%, against 67.1% in 2015 when AAP recorded a spectacular victory.

The voter turnout in the capital had been consistently going up since 1998 when just about 49% of the electorate had stepped out to cast votes. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, 60.6% voters had exercised their franchise. Delhi election officials said though the voter turnout had crossed the 2019 parliamentary election figure, it won't reach anywhere close to the 2015 one.

Interestingly, in absolute terms, some 1.62 lakh more people voted on Saturday as compared with the 2015 polls.

Accepting that the voter turnout was less than expected, election officials said it was too early to look for reasons. ""Several factors contribute to the voter turnout. We are still waiting for the final numbers and won't comment on it yet,"" said chief electoral officer of Delhi Ranbir Singh.

While final numbers are still being computed, Seelampur in northest Delhi reported the largest turnout of 71.4% followed by 70.6% in Mustafabad assembly segment. Delhi Cantonment witnessed the least number of people coming out to vote at 41.3% followed by Chhattarpur with 46.5%.

Though it was a triangular contest in most seats, the battle was essentially between AAP and BJP. AAP had sought votes on the work its government had done in health, education, water and other sectors, including giving free power, water and bus rides to women. BJP made it essentially an election on national security and nationalism. It highlighted the protests against the amended citizenship law, abrogation of Article 370 and 35A, the SC judgment in the Ram temple case and surgical strikes on Pakistan.",None
"It is so much easier and happier when everyone else but us is in the wrong

A few days ago, I had an interesting chat with a gentleman; let's call him H, a huge BJP supporter. H told me he was deeply disappointed with the party; that they had conclusively proven they were clueless about economics, policy or governance. But, said H, he would still vote BJP because, Hindutva. In 2014, I remember the same people insisting they were voting for progress, development and administration. In 2020, it is a relief to see they no longer have to keep up the pretence.

H and his ilk will never forgive corruption or a failing economy or poor administration in any political party that dares to treat all religions as equal. But if the political party's avowed aim is Hindutva, then suddenly, they don't really care where the jobs are or if every single high-value contract steadily goes to a single company.

Anyway, a few days ago, I mailed H the names of the 13 Navy personnel, all Hindus, who have been arrested for spying for Pakistan. His response? ""They were greedy and stupid. Not evil. This distinction must be made."" I asked if he would make this distinction if the names had been Muslim or Christian. He hasn't replied yet.

And therein lies the crux. Neither criminality nor evil has a religion, but as long as we convince ourselves that being Hindu somehow absolves us of all criminality but being Muslim makes us intrinsically evil, we will carry the burden of communal bias with us to the grave.

Let us fast forward to the violence that broke out in Delhi this week. Ask yourself why a CAA protest that was peaceful for months would turn into a violent conflagration immediately after a BJP member named Kapil Mishra marched with a mob to a protest site and blatantly declared, with a smiling policeman standing next to him, ""After Trump leaves, not even the police can stop us. Either you stop the protest or else.""

The slogans shouted, the colour of the flags raised, the identifying of victims by religion, the religious shrines attacked -- there are videos and photos and ground reports that testify to all of this. But none of it will matter. Because if you are Hindu and you commit a crime, you are blinded by passion or you are provoked or you're angry or it is in self-defence -- but you are never communal and you are never biased and you are never, ever evil.

In Delhi this week, both Hindus and Muslims have been killed and injured and had their property destroyed. But as the days and the WhatsApp forwards and the TV programmes unfold, one thing will soon become absolutely clear to all of us. Every Hindu victim we will find was attacked by bloodthirsty, communal, religious bigots whose only aim is to destroy Hindus and break up India. All other victims? Mere collateral damage.

So, what provoked us peaceful Hindus to inflict this erm... collateral damage? The CAA protest. And why should that be? Isn't Delhi immune to protests by now? Marches for Nirbhaya, vigils for Jessica Lal, millions of farmers squatting, Dalit marches, Section 377 parades... the list is endless. Surely they could have ignored this one, too?

Ah, but you forget. This protest was by Muslims. How dare a minority community that is here on our sufferance protest? How dare they keep it peaceful? How dare their 'backward' women find a voice? How dare they sing the national anthem and raise the tricolour? How dare they include inter-faith songs and prayers? How dare their leaders speak like statesmen and advise peace and non-violence?

Every demonising stereotype so carefully cultivated around the community over the last few years was systematically broken by the CAA protests. And that is why Delhi had to burn.

In the ensuing mayhem, we can always get away with murder because we are Hindu (and the cops are with us), but over the coming weeks we will be able to frame a hundred TV programmes that satisfyingly condemn and label everyone else as terrorists, anti-nationals and criminals. Once all the stereotypes are thus re-established, we will be able to happily return to the moribund economy and Melania Trump's designer sherwani and our morally pure lives, convinced that we can never do wrong.",BJP
"NDA ally Lok Janshakti Party's chief Chirag Paswan expressed strong disapproval of Singh's remarks

The country is paying the price for its failure to send Muslims to Pakistan and bring Hindus to India after the Islamic state came into being at the time of Independence, Union minister Giriraj Singh has said, triggering a fresh controversy.

The BJP leader made the remark in Purnea district in the Seemanchal region of Bihar which has a sizeable Muslim population and where the Begusarai MP was canvassing in favour of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Highlighting the need for such a legislation, he told reporters late Thursday ""when our forefathers were fighting for Independence from British rule, Jinnah was pushing for the creation of an Islamic state"".

""Our forefathers, however, committed a mistake. Had they ensured that all our Muslim brothers were sent to Pakistan and Hindus brought here, the need for such a move (CAA) would not have arisen. This did not happen and we have paid a heavy price for it,"" the BJP leader said.

The CAA, which seeks to fast-track granting citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who might have fled their home countries because of religious persecution, has become a major bone of contention since it is feared that a country-wide National Register for Citizens (NRC) may follow.

The Narendra Modi government, which had formerly hinted that a country-wide NRC was on the anvil, seems to have put it on the back-burner though a section of citizens across the country, especially Muslims, have been organising protests out of fear that, if implemented, the NRC may result in a large number of people becoming Stateless.

Singh has often been in the crosshairs of the opposition for placing his foot in the mouth. This time, however, his words were frowned upon even by NDA ally Lok Janshakti Party, founded by his cabinet colleague Ram Vilas Paswan and now headed by his son Chirag Paswan.

The young LJP chief, who kicked off a state-wide ""Bihar First-Bihari First"" yatra here Friday morning, to project the NDAs progressive face ahead of the assembly polls due later this year, expressed strong disapproval of Singh's utterance and noted the coalition had to suffer in the Delhi polls because of ""divisive"" remarks by BJP leaders.

""We are an NDA constituent but many times our coalition partners say things which the LJP does not at all agree with. This one (Giriraj Singh's statement) is such an example. Had a person of my party spoken in this fashion, I would have taken responsibility and acted,"" Paswan said.

He said he had placed his view repeatedly on record that the coalition had to suffer on account of divisive remarks, Paswan said in apparent reference to inflammatory speeches by BJP leaders like Union minister Anurag Thakur and BJP MP Parvesh Verma, among others.

""The people of Delhi voted on the basis of performance. We wish they do so again in Bihar and real issues don't get drowned in political cacophony.

""The Nitish Kumar government has accomplished a lot, though much more needs to be achieved. We wish to reach out to people with our vision for the future, said Paswan, before he embarked on the yatra on a customised bus decorated like a chariot in front of which he offered prayers and smashed a coconut.

Meanwhile, Giriraj Singh who loves to wear his Hindu nationalism on the sleeves was busy joining issue with Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM which has been under attack for controversial remarks by its leader Waris Pathan.

Sharing a video of an old speech by Owaisi's brother Akbaruddin which had landed him in jail, besides Pathan's recent remark, Singh asked the opposition RJD-Congress combine in Bihar and the ""tukde tukde gang"" whether they wanted to ""convert India into Pakistan"".",BJP
"Aam Aadmi Party's emphatic victory in the 2020 Delhi assembly election is a revolution in the way politics is done in this country and will set benchmarks for other political parties nationally.

Eight years back, AAP had forayed into politics to provide an honest alternative to citizens. Several such attempts in the past have withered away within a few years. The fact that AAP has emerged strong and tall after completing a full term in government despite repeated attempts to stall its progress indicates not just an electoral but a moral victory for the Kejriwal model of development.

This model makes clean and able governance and provision of basic infrastructure and amenities as its sole focus. It is the relentless pursuit to not just provide fundamental necessities like education, health, electricity, water, sanitation, women safety and transport to people but to do it in a transparent and equitable manner that has led to this historic mandate for AAP.

The Kejriwal model of development stands in contrast to the identity politics that had held sway in India so far because it creates a new identity in politics altogether -- that of a party which works for the welfare of all. Every common person, every citizen can associate itself with AAP's politics even as they hold on to their religious, caste, societal, gender affiliations. AAP stands for progress of all classes and all masses, no discrimination whatsoever. Kejriwal model of development also advances a new narrative of patriotism, one which doesn't evoke feelings of nationalism by dividing society on communal lines or by raking up the bogey of Pakistan whenever convenient.

This model of development promotes patriotism which comes from knowing that your government has provided access to world-class education and healthcare for every child of India -- rich or poor. That our homes too can have 24x7 electricity and water, and that our homeless too can sleep with dignity on the harshest of winter nights.

Not just the people of Delhi, but the people of India too have seen how AAP worked against all odds and how every effort was made to fight for the rights of people of Delhi, even as BJP at the Centre, with all its power and resources, only created roadblocks. It is noteworthy that a democratically elected government, which won a huge mandate, was prevented from doing its work for petty politics by a party which cites its own electoral mandate to justify anything and everything under the sun.

And yet, AAP under Arvind Kejriwal stood committed to its model of development and consciously chose to rise above these political differences and focus only on the work at hand -- progress for Delhi and all its citizens. AAP's victory is not just a victory for any of its leaders, but for the people, who have unequivocally announced, through their vote, that if a party works sincerely for five years, then it doesn't need to rake up imaginary issues at the time of election. It can go to people with its 'report card' and get rewarded.

This election victory for Aam Aadmi Party is also a wake-up call for all other political parties because now they know that people in their states will point to the work AAP has done in Delhi and demand the same from their governments. Top class government schools, hospitals, clinics, 24x7 electricity, cheap electricity and water can happen everywhere in India, just look at Delhi -- the people of other states will demand knowing that all of this can be delivered if a government is committed to it.

The Kejriwal model of development is not just in people's interest but in national interest because it is only when our governments focus relentlessly on the work they have been elected to do that a nation as a whole, each and every citizen in tow, will progress towards greater heights. Today Delhi has shown that it stands with this model of development, this definition of patriotism. Tomorrow more states will follow and soon India will seen a new dawn of politics emerging to which every citizen can proudly associate itself with.",aap
"Rahul Gandhi said this when he was asked about Modi's ""tubelight"" barb at him during his reply to the motion of thanks to the President's address in the Lok Sabha on January 6.

Hitting back at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his ""tubelight"" barb, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday said he does not behave like a Prime Minister.

He also alleged that the ruckus in the Lok Sabha was ""orchestrated"" to prevent him from questioning the government.

""Normally, a Prime Minister has a particular status, a Prime Minister has a particular way of behaving, a particular stature, our Prime Minister doesn't have these. He does not behave in a prime ministerial way,"" he told reporters outside Parliament.

Mr. Gandhi said this when he was asked about Modi's ""tubelight"" barb at him during his reply to the motion of thanks to the President's address in the Lok Sabha on Thursday.

He also said: ""We are being stifled and we are not being allowed to speak in Parliament. They have suppressed our voices.""

On Friday, there was an uproar in the Lok Sabha over comments made by BJP MP and Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan against Mr. Gandhi. The House was adjourned for the day at 2 p.m.

""The orchestrated ruckus in Parliament today was designed to prevent me from questioning the government. The youth of India can clearly see that the PM has no clue about how to tackle the unemployment crisis,"" said Mr. Gandhi.

""To protect him (Narendra Modi), the BJP will keep disrupting Parliament, preventing debate,"" the Congress leader said on Twitter later.

Mr. Gandhi told reporters that he was seeking to raise an issue of the people of his Lok Sabha constituency Wayanad not getting access to medical facilities in the absence of a medical college.

""But I was prevented from doing so,"" he said.

Mr. Vardhan's comments on Mr. Gandhi led to the ruckus in the Lok Sabha with some Congress MPs, including Manickam Tagore, protesting in the Well of the House.

""The BJP obviously does not like me to speak in the House. In a completely unparliamentary manner, the Union Health Minister raised something that I said outside, which he has no business of doing during the Question Hour. So, we were raising it with the Speaker,"" the former Congress chief said.

""I think, the main issue is that we are being stifled. We are not allowed to speak in Parliament. The health minister instead of giving an answer to my question, was raising some other issue. Where ever they can suppress our voice, they try to do that,"" he said.

Mr. Gandhi denied that Mr. Tagore attacked anyone and alleged that he was instead attacked.

""Yesterday, the Prime Minister gave a long speech, I asked him what is happening about jobs and employment. The Prime Minister talked about Jawaharlal Nehru, he spoke about Pakistan and all sorts of things, the Congress party, but the Prime Minister is unable to answer what he is doing to give jobs to the youth of the country.

"Delhi Elections 2020: Amit Shah asked voters in Delhi to choose between those who eliminate terrorists through surgical strikes and airstrikes carried out inside Pakistan and those who support Shaheen Bagh.

BJP leader and home minister Amit Shah has thrown a virtual challenge to Delhi Chief Minister and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal to retain his assembly seat of New Delhi in the February 8 polls. Shah, who is leading the BJP's election campaign, said the ground under Kejriwal's feet was slipping and the Delhi assembly results will show that.

In 2015 polls, Kejriwal had won the New Delhi seat by defeating BJP's Nupur Sharma by over 30,000 votes. The BJP has fielded Sunil Yadav, the president of the Delhi unit of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), against Kejriwal this time.

Shah said 'lotus' (BJP's electoral symbol) will bloom on the New Delhi seat this time.

""Kejriwal ji leave the rest of Delhi, go to your New Delhi seat. This time ground has slipped from under your feet. I will tell media colleagues on counting day, focus on that seat and see the result. This time a lotus named Sunil Yadav will bloom there,"" said Shah during a rally in Chhatarpur, south Delhi.

Shah's challenge to Kejriwal comes amid AAP allegations that BJP was deliberately stoking unrest in the capital and allowing the law and order to deteriorate so that it could be used as an excuse to postpone assembly elections. AAP leader Sanjay Singh made the allegations while reacting to the incident of an armed man opening fire on those protesting against the amended citizenship law near Jamia Millia University on Thursday. A student was injured in the incident. The AAP leader said that Shah was planning to destabilise Delhi.

Shah, however, appeared undeterred by the charge as he launched a blistering attack against the AAP and said the choice is between those who eliminate terrorists and those who support Shaheen Bagh.

""Two forces are face to face in the assembly elections in Delhi. On one side is Prime Minister Narendra Modi who eliminated terrorists through air and surgical strikes inside Pakistan and on the other hand are those supporting Shaheen Bagh. You have to decide whom do you support,"" he said.

Attacking senior AAP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, Shah said the BJP was with thousands of Pakistani refugees living in Delhi's Sanjay Colony.

""Sisodia said I am with Shaheen Bagh. Now I am saying we are with Sanjay Colony. I want to say to Dalits who came from Pakistan and settled in Sanjay Colony that you have as much right over this country as I and my son have,"" he said.

Shah said Kejriwal had failed to fulfil promises he made before elections. He said Kejriwal had sworn against using government accommodation and vehicle but gladly accepted the privileges after coming to power.

Shah also claimed that Kejriwal's promises on clean water, smooth roads, new schools and colleges and CCTV installations were all lies and BJP had a right to question them.

""When we question Kejriwal on his false promises, he alleges it to be an insult to Delhi residents. Why will it be an insult to people of Delhi, they are our brothers and sisters. Don't we have a right to question your (Kejriwal's) lies. Do you consider yourself to be Delhi,"" Shah said.

Shah also repeated his accusation that Kejriwal had misused Anna Hazare-led civil movement. Delhi will go to polls on February 8 and the campaigning will end on February 6.",BJP
"NEW DELHI: Ahead of US President Donald Trump's maiden visit to India, former Union minister and Congress leader Anand Sharma on Sunday said so far there are no positive indications that the high profile visit would yield any major outcomes.

However, former external affairs minister S M Krishna feels the visit assumes importance as both the US and India need to nourish and maintain the relationship between them further.

The US president and First Lady Melania Trump will be in India from February 24 to 25.

The visit is important in relation to the fact that the US is a major power, but that is all, Sharma said.

""So far I do not have any positive indication of any major outcome. It will be a continuation of defence and security cooperation, and a reaffirmation of our cooperation in space and nuclear sciences. It is ongoing and it will not be a new thing,"" Sharma, a former minister who handled external affairs under the Congress-led UPA 1, told PTI.

Krishna, who was external affairs minister during the UPA and is now in the BJP, feels though Trump's visit comes in the US presidential election year and a sizeable Indian expatriate population will vote, ""it should not be looked at from the narrow prism of US President's election"".

""It needs to be looked at a larger perspective as to what is happening in the region,"" he said.

Krishna said China will be closely monitoring the visit and the nature of talks that take place.

""It is a very important visit. The US and India have a very close and fruitful relationship especially after the Nuclear Accord. We have moved strategically close to each other and it is important for us to nourish and maintain the relationship further,"" he told PTI.

Asked about the possible outcomes, he said he was not privy to the agenda of Trump and Prime Minister Modi. But some treaties would surely be signed and some issues concerning the two countries would be taken up when a meeting of this kind takes place, Krishna said.

""It need not necessarily be bilateral as the outcomes may have the kind of impact that concerns the region,"" he said, noting that China and Pakistan would certainly be discussed.

Congress leader Sharma claimed that during the visit, there would neither be any trade agreement nor restoration of India's status under the Generalized System of Preference (GSP) bracket which the country previously had.

""There won't be any trade agreement. There won't be restoration of the GSP with all indications and the US making negative statements,"" he said.

""By putting India in the bracket of developed countries list, the US would drastically cut down any of the access and even the H1B visas which were available to India as a developing country because the US has quotas. So let us see. Except for a helicopter deal, there appears nothing in the offing,"" Sharma said.

He said ""we would have to wait and see if there will be outcomes"".

On whether Trump's visit would mean anything with regard to Pakistan, he said it was unlikely.

""US President Trump will give one message today and he will give another message tomorrow. He has done this in the past. Do not forget after the 'Howdy, Modi' event in Houston how he met Pakistan PM Imran Khan. So let us wait. They will not take an extreme position.

""They need Pakistan also for what they are doing in Afghanistan,"" said the deputy leader of the Congress in Rajya Sabha.

Sharma said the Trump visit should also not be seen as an attempt to balance the rise of China.

""China is five times bigger than us. India is in no position to balance. The US has its own equations with China (which) one should not forget. They make noises but they reach agreements quickly. They have a trade agreement. Let us wait,"" the Congress leader said.",None
"NEW DELHI: Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), a key BJP ally, on Thursday slammed a couple of saffron leaders, saying their ""inflammatory"" statements had led to violence in northeast Delhi.

Talking to TOI, LJP president and second-time MP, Chirag Paswan said, ""The top BJP leadership should take immediate action against its leaders like Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma and Giriraj Singh for their hate speeches and statements. If Mishra's statement added fuel to fire in North-East Delhi, Thakur's statement of 'goli maro' had impact on protests and violence in Jamia area.""

""Action needs to be taken against all these leaders who vitiated the atmosphere. I am naming them. The manner in which Kapil Mishra talked about action once US President Donald Trump leaves the country and that too in the presence of senior policemen was one of the main reasons for the violence,"" he said.

Chirag also criticised a recent statement of Union minister Giriraj Singh who had said, ""Our forefathers committed a mistake. Had they ensured that all our Muslim brothers were sent to Pakistan during Partition in 1947 and the Hindus were brought here (from Pakistan), the need for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act would not have arisen. But this did not happen, and we paid a heavy price for it. When our forefathers were fighting for independence, Jinnah was pushing for creation of an Islamic state.""

The LJP chief said such statements are wrong and the BJP leadership should take action against those making them. ""This country is of all of us; as much for Hindus as for Muslims, Sikhs and Christians. Every section has contributed to the country's development. You can't blame or sideline a section of the society,"" he said.

"In his first public address after the Delhi elections, Union home minister Amit Shah has said that BJP may have lost the polls because of controversial statements like ""goli maaro"" and ""India-Pakistan match"". However, he added that there was no way to really know why people pressed which button inside a polling booth. While it might be too much of a loss of face for BJP leadership to admit that their campaign strategy in Delhi was wrong, the fact that Shah is willing to concede that provocative slogans may have contributed to BJP's defeat is a good sign.

Over the last six years, BJP's campaign strategy for most elections has been based on dog whistle communalism and polarisation. While this may have seen the party reap rich political dividends in several instances, it isn't a formula that can be used repeatedly. Beyond a point, people see through the strategy and start demanding answers on the governance front. This is precisely what happened in Delhi where people seem to have voted for AAP on the basis of its focus on governance issues. Plus, constantly trying to polarise the electorate for electoral benefits damages the social fabric. This is again something that the larger public won't put up with since it harms everyone.

Thus, BJP needs to review its electoral strategy. It has created a party culture where members think it is fine to make provocative statements. In fact, as the Delhi campaign showed, many even think this is the way to get ahead in the party. But having lost a string of state elections, BJP should realise that polarisation as a strategy may motivate its core supporters, but won't help gain the confidence of the majority of the electorate. With Bihar and Bengal polls next on the political calendar, BJP has to change track. Otherwise, it risks biting the dust once again.",BJP

While addressing a gathering, Modi had said his government will not go back on its decision to implement the new citizenship law and Article 370 despite facing pressure to scrap the two legislations. The Sena, in its editorial in mouthpiece Saamana, questioned the PM and asked him who is putting pressure on him to go back on the decisions.

The Uddhav Thackeray-led party also said that BJP's defeat in the recently-concluded Delhi Assembly polls has shown that PM Modi needs to ""change his direction"". The editorial said that repeating the speech may win ""applause but the votes get diverted elsewhere as seen in the Delhi polls"".

""What will you do if such a thing [defeat] happens in Varanasi [Modi's Lok Sabha constituency],"" the editorial questioned.

""Prime Minister Modi [in his speech] in Varanasi declared that 'the government will not go back in CAA and Kashmir's Article 370; No matter how much pressure, our government is firm on the decision'... PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah said this in all their speeches [while campaigning in Delhi]. This was the BJP's campaign [for Delhi polls] but it didn't work and the people rejected it... Now the PM has made the same speech in Varanasi. The only question is who is putting pressure on Modi to go back on CAA and Article 370. He [Modi] should clarify on this,"" the editorial said.

The party backed the Centre's decision to abrogate the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir through Article 370 but slammed the government on the current situation and asked what has changed after the decision. The editorial said that that when the question on the return of Kashmiri Pandits to the Valley is asked, Modi says that the government will not revoke the decision.

""We are saying not go back on the decision, but don't go back on your word either. You have given your word on the 'ghar wapsi' of Kashmiri Pandits. And who had given the promise to take back Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to fulfil the dream of an undivided India?"" questioned the Sena, adding that the government has not fulfilled the promise to bring industries and business to Kashmir.

The editorial also stated that the government should clear the doubts of the citizens on CAA and ""resolve the issue"".",None
"Rajdeep Sardesai examines the election machine, resources, welfare, nationalism, Hindutva mobilisation, the use of the media and the mobile, and the persona of Narendra Modi himself to explain why the BJP did as well as it did in the 2019 election

Rajdeep Sardesai, among the pioneers of Indian news television, has an important skill in these politically polarised times. He can make a distinction between his political opinion -- based on his world view and his ideological beliefs -- and his political analysis -- based on his ground reportage and the reading of larger political trends and public sentiment.

Sardesai's own politics is liberal and moderate; he is a critic of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s Hindutva world view. But this does not prevent him from recognising the underlying strengths of the party and its leadership. It is this ability to distinguish between his desire for what ought to be, the normative, with what is, the empirical, which made Sardesai one of the few journalists to have anticipated not just the fact that Narendra Modi would return to power in 2019, but also correctly assess the scale of his victory.

Sardesai has two other assets. The first is access. Decades in Delhi's political journalism circuit has ensured he has a range of relationships across the spectrum, except perhaps with the top most leadership of the BJP in current times. He also continues to be a reporter, rather than just an anchor, travelling to the ground during elections, which has kept his instinct sharp.

It is this set of skills -- access, ground reportage, sound analysis, and a sharp political sense -- which Sardesai has deployed to put together his latest work, 2019: How Modi Won India.

The book is simple -- and quite effective -- in its argument and structure. And for those who closely followed the election, there is a lot which is familiar.

Sardesai documents how this was a truly TIMO -- There Is Modi Only -- election. This is true. For voters, the issue of national leadership was the leading concern. And the BJP made it clear in its campaign that the vote was for the leader. If it had depended on local candidates, it may -- and this is speculative -- have probably won half the seats it did. The Opposition just did not have anyone who could match Modi in the public imagination. Voters saw in the PM a Hindu leader, or a man committed to India's development, or a messiah for the poor, or a nationalist securing India against enemies, or all of the above. More than in 2014, this election was truly presidential in nature. It exposed the limits of the Congress strategy of turning it into 543 local contests. And if the current trend holds, the Opposition may well have to think whether it can present a single, credible face for 2024, and build the person's image accordingly.

The second element in the BJP's winning arsenal was the election machine created by Amit Shah. The book conveys Shah's ideological clarity, his organisational skills, his ability to work hard, and, through brief interactions that Sardesai had with him on either social occasions or in Parliament, Shah's own views on particular issues or personal interests. There is little doubt that under Shah, the BJP became what I have called India's greatest election machine. Through membership drives, a database of its members and supporters, constant campaigns, and a robust structure down to the booth and even the level of electoral roll pages, the BJP was able to take its brand and message down to the roots. Shah also succeeded in geographically expanding the party's footprint, especially in West Bengal.

All of this, of course, costs money. Sardesai makes the point that BJP was the richest party, by a stretch, in the elections. But the issue merited more detailed treatment. Recent reports on the electoral bonds have shown that processes may have been subverted to institute a system which has substantially benefited the BJP. It would be a mistake to overstate the role of money in BJP's win; it would be just as much of a mistake to understate it.

The other key ingredient of the BJP's 2019 success was the role of the government's welfare delivery schemes. From gas cylinders to toilets, rural housing to bank accounts, the Modi government not only delivered benefits, but made it known that it had done so.

This was combined with what Sardesai calls the rise of the political Hindu. The BJP's campaign has been focused on consolidating both a majority and a majoritarian identity. This helps it unite Hindus -- the goal of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh -- and overcome caste divisions. This has often taken the form of excluding, and even rhetorically targeting Muslims. The ongoing Delhi election campaign is a reflection of the BJP's shrill polarisation strategy. The discredited politics of secularism of the past, where parties merely treated minority groups as vote banks, did create grounds for this backlash. But the BJP's ideological commitment to remaking the state on Hindutva lines is quite deep and goes beyond elections. This has been visible in the past nine months, with the government using its electoral mandate to push changes in Jammu and Kashmir and amend the Citizenship Act.

The BJP, then, benefited from the nationalist mood. The killing of paramilitary personnel in Pulwama had created national horror. The PM told the national security apparatus that he wanted visible action. With the air strike in Balakot, the party machine went into an overdrive -- to portray Modi as the only leader capable of defending India's interests and teaching Pakistan a lesson. The BJP may still have won in 2019, but Balakot did enthuse the cadre and provide a bump.

Read more:?BJP is getting its messaging wrong, writes Rajdeep Sardesai

But to take this message down to each polling booth and voter, the machine and the brand needed an additional ally: the media. Sardesai has invested considerable space in examining the compromised nature of the media, particularly sections of the electronic media, which have been more than cheerleaders for the regime in power. In addition, the BJP astutely used the deepening penetration of the mobile phone to reach voters directly, particularly through WhatsApp and other forms of social media.

Put it all together -- Modi, the election machine, resources, welfare, nationalism, Hindutva mobilisation, and the use of the media and mobile -- and it is not a surprise that the BJP did as well as it did in the 2019 election. Sardesai's work is a competent examination of these, and other, ingredients. Perhaps he needs to now shift focus, from examining how the BJP wins to how the BJP governs, for that will now determine the trajectory of the Republic.",BJP
